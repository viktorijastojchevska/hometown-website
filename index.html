                <h2>The taste of tradition...</h2>
                <p>The Macedonian traditional food is probably one of the best in the Balkans. Macedonian cuisine is influenced by Ottoman Turkish cuisine and shares characteristics of other Balkan cuisines. <br><br> The relatively warm climate of the country provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its dairy products, wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as rakija.</p>
